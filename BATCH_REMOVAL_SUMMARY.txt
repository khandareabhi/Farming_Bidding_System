## 📌 Notes:

- The batch bidding system is **fully restored** to original state
- The **language selector feature remains** (separate from bidding system)
- All new direct bidding features have been removed
- Original `place_bid.php` workflow still applies (navigate through `biding_page.php`)
- Batch file (`run_bids.bat`) - if needed, can be recreated with original code

## 🧪 Testing:

After revert, the system works as originally:
1. Bidder goes to "Bid to Product" → `biding_page.php`
2. Places bid via `place_bid.php`
3. Batch file (`run_bids.bat`) runs periodically via Task Scheduler
4. `auto_bid_update.php` marks auctions as sold after end time
